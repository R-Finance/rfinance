The sixteenth annual R/Finance conference for applied finance using R will be held on May 17th and 18th, 2024 in Chicago, IL, at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu). The conference will cover topics including advanced risk tools, decentralized finance, econometrics, high-performance computing, market microstructure, portfolio management, time series analysis, and more. All will be discussed within the context of using R and related programming languages as primary tools for data pipelines, financial model development, portfolio construction, risk management, and trading.

From its humble Midwest beginnings, word of the conference spread among trading desks and universities, until it became the primary meeting for academics and practitioners interested in using R in quantitative finance. The conference has featured presentations from prominent academics and practitioners, and we anticipate another exciting line-up for 2024.

We invite you to submit complete papers in pdf format, or one-page abstracts (in txt or pdf format). More complete papers are preferred, as well as submissions that include working code. We welcome submissions for full talks (approximately 20 min.), abbreviated "lightning talks" (approx. 6 min.), as well as (1 hr.) pre-conference tutorials. (Scheduling considerations may require requested full talks moved to lightning).

Both academic and practitioner proposals related to R are encouraged. We especially encourage those who were previously unaware of R/Finance to submit their talk proposals. There are many benefits to giving a presentation at the conference. It makes your work visible to the community, which often leads to interesting conversations with others about your work. A full paper is not required!

In an effort to increase diversity of the presentations and presenters at the conference, the committee asks and encourages members of under-represented or historically marginalized groups to respond to the Call for Presentations. See the [Diversity](/diversity) page for more information.

All slides will be made publicly available at conference time. Presenters are strongly encouraged to provide working R code to accompany the slides. Ideally, data sets should be made public for the purposes of reproducibility (though we realize this may be limited due to contracts with data vendors). Preference may be given to innovative research or presenters who have released R packages.

Limited financial assistance for conference admission may be available to presenters. As R/Finance is a volunteer open source effort from which organizers do not profit, resources are derived from registrations and sponsorship alone. Requests for financial assistance must be made at the time of submission, and the presenter should clearly communicate to us why assistance is being requested. We welcome requests from underrepresented minorities in Quantitative Finance/STEM, and anyone researching under economic hardship.

Submissions will be reviewed and accepted on a rolling basis with a final submission deadline of January 26th, 2024. Submitters will be notified via email starting February 14, 2024 of acceptance and presentation length.

Additional details will be announced via the conference website http://www.RinFinance.com/ as they become available. Information on previous years' presenters and their presentations are also at the conference website. We will make a separate announcement when registration opens.
