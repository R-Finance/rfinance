The seventeenth annual Open Source Quantitative Finance conference (osQF, formerly R/Finance) will be held on **Friday & Saturday, April 11th-12th, 2025 at the University of Illinois Chicago**. The conference focuses on applied finance using open source programming languages and free software systems for statistical computation and graphics. The two day conference will cover topics including advanced risk tools, decentralized finance, econometrics, high-performance computing, market microstructure, portfolio management, and time series analysis. All will be discussed within the context of using open source programming languages as primary tools for financial model development, portfolio construction, risk management, and trading.

Over the past seventeen years, the conference formerly known as R/Finance has included work contributed in many open source programming languages. This year, we've formally changed the name to reflect our commitment to the broader open source programming language community in quantitative finance. As always, we expect to welcome attendees from around the world, host presentations from prominent academics and practitioners. We look forward to another exciting lineup for 2025!

Once again, we've partnered with the [Chicago R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/chicago-r-user-group/) and [PyData Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/pydatachi/) to kickoff the conference on the evening of Friday, April 11th. A series of relevant talks on quantitative finance will be presented, followed by an opportunity to sample Chicago's vibrant nightlife.
