The sixteenth annual R/Finance conference for applied finance using R will be
held on May 18, 2024 at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The conference
brings together some of the best people and conversation in quantitative
finance -- covering R (or Python or Julia!), portfolio construction,
statistics, quant ideas and more!

**Registration for [R/Finance 2024](https://go.uic.edu/RFinance2024 "R/Finance2024") is open!**

We're doing things a little different this year. We've partnered with the
[Chicago R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/chicago-r-user-group/) and
[PyData Chicago](https://www.meetup.com/pydatachi/) to kickoff the conference
on Friday, May 17th. This event will have a series of quantitative finance
presentations, followed by an opportunity to sample Chicago's vibrant nightlife.

On Saturday, we will have the usual presentations covering  topics including
advanced risk tools, decentralized finance, econometrics, high-performance
computing, market microstructure, portfolio management, and time series
analysis. All will be discussed within the context of using R and other
programming languages as primary tools for financial model development,
portfolio construction, risk management, and trading.

From its humble Midwest beginnings, word of the conference spread among trading
desks and universities, until it became the primary meeting for academics and
practitioners interested in using R in quantitative finance. Over the past
sixteen years, R/Finance has included attendees from around the world and
featured presentations from prominent academics and practitioners, and we have
another exciting lineup for 2024.

We look forward to seeing you in Chicago in May!
