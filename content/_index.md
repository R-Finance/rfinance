R/Finance is back, live and person for 2022! Join us in Chicago this Spring
for the 14th anniversary of the conference that brings together some of the
best people and conversation in quantitative finance -- covering R (or Python or Julia!),
portfolio construction, statistics, quant ideas and more.

We hope to see you this June 3rd and 4th at the University of Illinois at Chicago:

[R/Finance 2022 Call For Papers](https://web.cvent.com/event/2efa4ed6-5d94-44cf-9c15-e0ae8d78276e/summary?environment=P2 "R/Finance2020")

There is still time to submit a paper or abstract to speak. We are especially interested in
lightning talks at this point - if you have an interesting project, problem, or solution, feel
free to submit your abstract to the link above.

We will update this page when registration links open.

Looking forward to seeing everyone in Chicago in June!

Best,

R/Finance Committee
