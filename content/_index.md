The fifteenth annual R/Finance conference for applied finance using R will be
held on May 19 and 20, 2023 in Chicago, IL, at the University of Illinois at
Chicago. The conference brings together some of the best people and
conversation in quantitative finance -- covering R (or Python or Julia!),
portfolio construction, statistics, quant ideas and more!

**The [R/Finance 2023 Call For Papers](https://go.uic.edu/RFinanceCFP2023 "R/Finance2023") is open!**

We encourage you to submit complete papers (in pdf format), and we will also
consider one-page abstracts (in txt or pdf format). Papers closer to completion
and proposals that provide R code are preferred.

We welcome submissions for full talks (approximately 20 minutes), abbreviated
"lightning talks" (approximately 6 minutes), as well as (1 hour) pre-conference
tutorials. (Scheduling considerations may require requested full talks moved to
lightning). We encourage academic and practitioner proposals related to R.

You can submit your proposal at https://go.uic.edu/RFinanceCFP2023. Please share
the link with colleagues and peers. We would especially appreciate your help
sending the link to people from under-represented groups, and encouraging them
to submit a proposal!

We're looking forward to seeing everyone in Chicago in May!

Best,
R/Finance Committee
