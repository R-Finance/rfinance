R/Finance 2020 is less than 3 months away (June 5-6) and it's impossible to
predict how the global COVID-19 pandemic will continue to unfold. As you can
imagine, this uncertainty makes it extremely difficult to plan an
international conference with dozens of speakers and hundreds of attendees.

We hope COVID-19 is no longer a global threat in June, but we don't know the
extent that international travel and large gatherings will still be
discouraged.Due to that uncertainty, **we have decided to cancel this year's
R/Finance Conference**. This was a difficult decision, but the safety of our
attendees comes first.

We truly apologize for any inconvenience this may cause for you. And we
would like to invite you to submit a proposal and attend to next year's
conference. The date is yet to be determined, but will likely be in early
June.
