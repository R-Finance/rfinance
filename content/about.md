title: "About R/Finance"
subtitle: "Applied Finance with R"
---


R/Finance was founded in the fall of 2008, by a small group of open source 
package authors, finance industry practitioners, and finance professors. 
Inspired by popular workshops and summer schools about "R in Finance" held by 
Diethelm Würts at Meielisalp in the Swiss mountains, the inaugural R/Finance 
conference took place at the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois (UIC) 
in April 2009. 

From its humble beginning, R/Finance has maintained the single-track 
presentation model. With presentations by some of the most knowledgeable 
emerging and experienced professionals in the field, attendees never experience 
the fear of missing out on the most interesting content. Large round tables set 
in a single expansive conference hall encourage easy conversations among a group 
of participants originating from nearly every continent on the planet. Attendees
are given access to a [secure internet connection](https://accc.uic.edu/services/infrastructure/network/wireless/), 
and can quickly access markets, post content online, download and experiment 
with packages discovered at the conference, or write and commit code with new 
and existing open source collaborations.

At the heart of R/Finance is an open source community, uniquely unparalleled in 
both its breadth and depth. Emerging and experienced attendees alike return each 
year to build new relationships, deepen old ones, and be inspired by the
work of their peers. 

## R Packages and Code

In many important fields, valuable intellectual property is a closely held 
secret. Sometimes, we find published works and generalized approaches in close
proximity to these propriety methods. At R/Finance, sometimes these generalized 
approaches get developed, documented, packaged, and open sourced. 

Amidst an open atmosphere of relevant conversations, some of the most 
successful open source collaborations in both R and Finance have been 
created. Collaboration, driven by a deep intellectual curiosity and a commitment 
to high quality work, are a few of the values shaping the innovative culture at 
R/Finance. Open to all interested persons, we invite you to come develop with us.

## Curated Content  

Since 2009, attendees have enjoyed roughly 400 presentations. Accessible from 
the Archive tab, a balanced mix of keynotes, full talks, and lightning-talks 
cover a variety of topics with many on the leading edge of their respective 
fields. Our [call for presenters](https://www.rinfinance.com/cfp/) attracts high 
quality content from accomplished individuals, earning the multidisciplinary 
conference a reputation as one of the most important events of the year among 
researchers practicing and applying R in finance, business, and academia.

The roster of keynote speakers includes R-core members, pioneers in high 
frequency market making, economists of giant technology companies, best 
selling authors in quantitative finance, globally recognized software 
developers, CEO's of asset managers, quantitative institutional investors, 
and successful entrepreneurs. In addition, speakers include professors leading 
their respective fields using R in time series, econometrics, derivative 
securities, financial engineering, portfolio management, statistics, machine 
learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Organizing Committee 

Behind R/Finance, is a group of recognizable and emerging leaders in both the 
open source R and finance communities. The groups collective background includes 
working with large hedge funds, the Federal Reserve, high frequency market 
making firms, fintech companies, investment banks, commodity 
trading advisors, traditional asset managers, and highly ranked 
universities in areas of data analytics and quantitative finance.

In addition, the committee members are active developers, package authors, and
general contributors to the 
[R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/) and other open 
source endeavors. Some lead local R User Groups and organize more general R 
conferences. Others have managed or mentored 
[R projects for Google Summer of Code](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/). And 
still others have authored some of the most popular R packages used in finance, 
time series, financial econometrics, and high performance computing, as well as 
maintain [Empirical Finance](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Finance.html)
and [High-Performance and Parallel Computing withR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html) 
Task Views.

Among other logistics, the committees main focus is on attracting and curating 
high quality presentations. Leveraging domain expertise and professional 
networks, the committee strives to assemble a group of interesting and skilled 
presenters, with deep knowledge of applied finance and interrelated disciplines.
