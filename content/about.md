title: "About R/Finance"
subtitle: "Applied Finance with R"
---


R/Finance was founded in the fall of 2008, by a small group of open source 
package authors, finance industry practitioners, and finance professors. Inspired by 
popular workshops and summer schools about "R in Finance" held by Diethelm Wuerts 
at Meielisalp in the Swiss mountains, the inaugural R/Finance conference took 
place at the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois (UIC) in April 2009. 

From its humble beginning, R/Finance has maintained the single-track presentation 
model. With presentations from some of the most knowledgeable emerging and
experienced professionals in the field, attendees never experience the fear 
of missing out on the presentations they find most interesting. Large round 
tables set in a single expansive conference hall encourage easy conversations 
among a group of participants originating from nearly every continent on the 
planet. With access to a fast and scalable internet connection, participants can
quickly post notes online, share pictures of their favorite presentations, or
write and commit code to new and existing open source collaborations.

At the heart of R/Finance is an open source community, uniquely unparalleled in 
both its breadth and depth. Emerging and experienced participants alike return 
each year to build new relationships, deepen old ones, and be inspired by the
work of their peers. 

## R Packages and Code

In many important fields, valuable intellectual property is a closely held 
secret. Sometimes we find published works and generalized approaches in close
proximity to these propriety methods, and at R/Finance, sometimes these generalized 
approaches get developed, documented, packaged, and open sourced. A few of these
open source collaborations have produced R packages trusted and used by some
of the largest private investment and technology firms in existence today.

Amidst an open atmosphere of relevant conversations, some of the most 
successful open source collaborations in both R and Finance have been 
created. Collaboration, driven by a deep intellectual curiosity and a commitment 
to high quality work, are a few of the values shaping the innovative culture at 
R/Finance. Open to all interested persons, we invite you to come develop with us.

## Curated Content  

Since 2009, attendees have enjoyed roughly 400 presentations, each exploring 
some of the most interesting facets in the field today. A focus on curating
high quality content has earned the multi-disciplinary conference a reputation as 
one of the most important events of the year among researchers practicing and 
applying R in finance.

The roster of keynote speakers includes R-core members, pioneers 
in high frequency market making, economists with giant tech companies, best 
selling authors in quantitative finance, globally recognized high performance
software developers, CEOs of asset managers, quantitative institutional investors, 
and successful entrepreneurs. In addition, speakers include professors leading 
their respective fields using R in time series, econometrics, derivative 
securities, financial engineering, portfolio management, statistics, machine 
learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Organizing Committee 

Behind R/Finance, is a group of recognizable and emerging leaders in both the 
open source R and finance communities. The groups collective background includes 
working with large hedge funds, the Federal Reserve, high frequency market 
making firms, publicly traded fintech companies, investment banks, commodity 
trading advisors, traditional asset managers, and highly ranked 
universities in areas of data analytics and quantitative finance.

In addition, the committee members are active developers, package authors, and
general contributors to the [R Project for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/). 
Some lead local R User Groups and organize more general R conferences.
Others have managed or mentored [R projects for Google Summer of Code](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/). And still others have authored some of the 
most popular R packages used in finance, time series, financial econometrics, and 
high performance computing, as well as maintain
[Empirical Finance](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Finance.html)
and [High-Performance and Parallel Computing with R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html) Task Views.

Among other logistics, the committees main focus is on identifying and curating 
quality presentations. Leveraging domain expertise and professional networks, 
the commitee strives to assemble a group of interesting and skilled presenters, 
with deep knowledge of applied finance and interrelated disciplines.
