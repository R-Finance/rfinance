## Conference

R/Finance was founded in the fall of 2008, by a small group of open-source 
authors, finance practitioners, and academics. Inspired by the annual gatherings 
of finance industry practitioners and academics hosted by the Deithelm Wurts, 
the inaugural R/Finance conference took place in April 2009 at the University 
of Illinois-Chicago.

Over the last 12 years, attendees have enjoyed roughly 400 presentations, 
covering nearly all facets of finance, software development, and statistical 
programming with R. Consistent and excellent content has earned the conference
a reputation as one of the pre-eminent events of the year in R and quantitative 
finance. 

While some conferences divide attendees and speakers into multiple tracks,
R/Finance has kept the single track presentation model alive and well. With 
presentations from some of our industry's brightest, you won't miss any of it. 

A leader in hosting high quality, meaningful conferences, the R/Finance model 
has come to inspire other R organizers as well. Today, conferences intersecting 
the R Statistical Programming Language with Medicine, Insurance, and others, 
are succeeding in bringing together highly skilled R programmers with experts in
their respective fields.


## Community

At the core of R/Finance are the people, and the breadth and depth of the 
general community is as unparalleled as the content it produces. 
They include world class authors, industry professionals, students, professors, 
investors, and high performance software developers.  

Each Spring, new and old participants alike, come together to build new 
relationships, deepen old ones, and explore new research. Round tables set in an
expansive conference hall to facilitate easy conversations among participants 
originating from nearly every continent on the planet. This is where new open 
source collaborations are born, some of which have lasted more than a decade. 
Creating an environment where senior developers in R Statistical Programming and 
high performance computing can collaborate with domain experts specializing in 
several areas of Finance, Economics, and Business, is the essence of R/Finance.

Examples included work collaborations from Ryan, Eddebuettel, Carl, Peterson, 
Boudt, Ulrich, Pfaff, Zivot, Martin, Bassett, ..

## R Code

Modern approaches to computational finance are secretive, and the best ideas are 
closely guarded. But around these proprietary methods are published works, and 
industry best practices that benefit from being open sourced, reducing the 
workload of the silo'd new researcher working on the similar problems. These can 
be packaged, shared, and ultimatly refined by the end user for proprietary 
purposes. This unique collaborative environment among conference founders, 
committee members, speakers, and attendees, have produced R packages and 
code used to manage and trade some estimated Trillions of dollars in financial 
assets. This is the essence of R in Finance.

This packages include, quantmod, RQuantLib, Rcpp, PerformanceAnalytics, xts, 
zoo, RMetrics, rugarch, urca, vars, highfrequency, and many more.

## Team

Organizing the conference are individuals well known in Quantitative Finance 
and R, volunteering in service to the open source R and open finance 
communities. They have worked as industry practitioners for hedge funds, high 
frequency trading firms, mutual funds, investment consultant firms, the Federal 
Reserve, and have instructed at top Universities for analytics and
quantitative finance. See footer links for more details.

In addition, some have authored packages like Rcpp, quantmod, 
PerformanceAnalytics, quantstrat, IBrokers, xts, TTR, RQuantLib, 
Quantile Regression, wooldridge, and more.
